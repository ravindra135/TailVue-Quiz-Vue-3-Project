## 📝 About the Project

**TailVue** is a simple Quiz App developed as a practice project while learning **Vue 3**. The goal of this app is to reinforce the basics of Vue JS—like component structure, state management, conditional rendering, and props—through a fun and interactive experience.

I’ve open-sourced this project in hopes that more experienced developers can help me improve the code quality, structure, and share tips or best practices so I can level up my skills.
